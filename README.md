# Driven

# Vision 
Provide a universal address portal to the people who move to avoid conflicting addresses in different platforms and better track their mails and packages.
# Motivation 
Addresses are a crucial part of someone's identity and are a mode of communication for different services and platforms (like Banks, Healthcare, government, corportates) and the user. Usually when people move they have to change their address in a lot of such platforms and due to human or system errors there is always a high chance of address inconsistency between these platforms. This leads to problems like the mail or package being sent to a different or older address. This is a big problem and on top of that changing addresses manually in all these sites is a pain. We would like to automate this process by creating a universal portal for all your addresses. This is a one-stop-shop where you can change your address and provide an `address_id` to all the sites that require your address and then these sites will do an API call to the Driven DB to grab your most recent address.
